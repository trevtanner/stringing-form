## Lacrosse Stringing Form
This project is a form that takes the place of a written stringing form, and saving the information into a mySQL database. 
Uses html, css, and php to make and submit the form. This program is created specificlly for Tama Lacrosse, but may be used 
by anyone by changing or removing the logo, title and copyright info in the footer. This project will have many edits going
forward so be sure to check if using 2 different versions. 

## Motivations
This project serves as a stepping off point for my php/mySQL development so anytime I learn new info it will be added to this
project. I built this form as a former lacrosse store worker who strung many a heads an filled out too many handwritten forms. 
The biggest issued faced is there was no there record of the order besides the payment if the paper order was lost. Hopefully
this one can be developed enough to actually inegrate and used in store, but will be a great project none the less. This is used
as a final project for my PHP Programming class thru Santa Monica College.

## Languages Used
built with
- HTML
- CSS
- PHP

##Features
Makes use of mySQL for saving order forms. Make sure to change the connection info for the correct mySQL database in use. PHP is the 
main languague used in this file so be sure to have a server running before editting files. As said before this code will change
constantly so use with caution unless stated otherwise.
